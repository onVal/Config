# Home configuration files
### Requirements
Mac os system

### Set up
Clone this repo on `~/.dotfiles`. (it needs to be in that folder for the script to work)\

Run `chmod +x` init.sh to give the script executable permissions
Run `./init.sh` script to set up your new system.

### Issues
-brew cask install ain't installing stuff
-vim color theme is not applied (even tho it's been copied correctly)
-zshrc doesn't seem to get applied (nor the cool theme)
